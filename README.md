# ChorusFinder
This is a basic chorus finder. It is able to identify the longest repeated substring in a body of text using a co-occurrence matrix. Performance improvements welcomed.

### Usage
```
./chorus_finder.py -f rick.txt
```
output:
```
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
```
